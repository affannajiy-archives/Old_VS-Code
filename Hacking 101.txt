Hacking 101

Ethical hacking -> a discipline of hacking
* 5 hacking hats (White, Black, Gray, Red, Blue)
==> ethical hackers fall into the white hats

human hacking (social engineering) -> manipulation 

Why Kali Linux?
*pre installed with 600 tools
*open source OS (customizable and flexible)

What is "sudo"? -> super user do

Directory is just a folder
File is a just a file (.txt)

ls -l
ls -> list
- = regular files
d = directory 

r = read (view the content)
w = write (change content)
x = execute (interact content)
# rwx

group - the other users you are in with (complicated to explain now)

chmod a+w filename

cd -> change directory [VERY IMPORTANT]
cp -> copy
rm file -> permenantly delete file
cat -> combining the file together
strings -> can only print from binary file

metadata -> exp, see a picture (red.jpg) it will tell everything about the metadata

binwalk -e firmware.bin
cd _firmware.bin.extracted/
strings extracted_file

bruteforce -> submitting many passwords or paraphrases with guess of correctly guessing (very inefficient but still can get)
rainbow table -> txtfiles to use common passwords to get the right one

cd Desktop
zip --password 1234 ok.zip catnnoir.jpeg
zip2john ok.zip
